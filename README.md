# ar-halo-drone

ARHaloDrone is a native iOS augmented reality prototype written in Swift that anchors a spartan with their personal conceptual drone to the real world. Users 
can control the spartan's conceptual drone with ability to move in any direciton. The intention of this project was to showcase in augmented reality the conceptual 
idea for spartan's to have personal drones that can fly around the map to find and report the locations of enemies.
